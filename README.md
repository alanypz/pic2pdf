## Step-by-Step Build Instructions

** Open Project in Xcode **

1. Launch Xcode. Navigate to File > Open.

2. Navigate to the root project folder and select the Xcode Project. 

** Build application on iOS device **

1.  In the main view of the Xcode project, there are three 
square buttons in the top left part of the window. The first 
two are Build (Triangle picture) and Stop (Square picture) 
buttons.

2. The third button should say "Converter" on its left half. 
Click on the right side of this button instead. This will 
open a dropdown menu. Scroll to the "iOS Simulators" section and select an iPhone 5 or newer.

3. Hit the Build button. You should now be able to test the app within the mobile simulator.

1. After hitting the build button, there will be some 
type of security error. Tapping the Converter App icon

2. On the iOS device, navigate to Settings > General > Profile. Select the email address displayed (the account of 
the creator). Select "Trust."

3. Return to the Xcode project and run the software again.
